Building Chatbot using Google Dialogflow: A Chatbot is a software or an agent or a service which simulates human conversation in natural language through messaging applications, websites, mobile phones, or telephone. They can be programmed to respond to simple keywords or prompts to complex discussions. A Chatbot has two different tasks at the core: analyze the request (identifying the intent of the user) and providing the response. Chatbots are of two types: one functions on a set of rules, and the other more advanced one uses artificial intelligence. 1. Chatbots that function on rules: It is easy to build and can get basics tasks done with limitations to specific commands. This bot performance would depend on programming skills. 2. Chatbots that function on machine learning: It understands languages and not just commands, it provides relevant responses from the previous experience and training. It communicates through speech or text, relying on AI technologies like machine learning and NLP.
